- 👋 Hi, I’m @justinhyi92

- :man_cook: About me: I am a former Chef in pursuit of a new career path in the Tech Industry because of my infatuation of all of its mechanics and technicalities. 

- :joystick: I’m incredibly interested in Game Development. I would love to learn anything and everything I can about it, from the back-end mechanics of what is it that makes      them work, to the design aspect and playability.

- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in Udacity's 'C++' NanoDegree Program with a completion date of June 2021. I have completed Udacity's 'Intro To Progamming' Nanodegree Program in April 2021. 

- 👀 My biggest values are work ethic, communication, and teamwork. As I come from the Restaurant Industry as a Chef, I have been instilled with these, what I believe to be, core values. Without these three core values, big dreams will never come into fruition.


- :nerd_face:	I’m looking to improve and develop on the skills I would need to help my new career path into Game Development.

- 💞️ The top preferences for my compatible work environment are a full-time position with benefits within the Gaming industry, growth opportunities, and is within 30 miles from my geographical location (if possible).
